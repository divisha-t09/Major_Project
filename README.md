## Introduction
The Sign Language Recognition System is a project developed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze hand gestures and convert them into text or spoken language. The system aims to provide a seamless communication experience for individuals who use sign language as their primary means of communication.

## Features
- Real-time sign language gesture recognition
- Conversion of gestures into visible text or spoken language
- User-friendly web-based interface for interaction
- High accuracy and robustness in gesture classification
- Support for multiple sign languages
